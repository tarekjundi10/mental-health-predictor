## Problem

Mental health conditions affect 1 in 4 people globally, yet most go undetected until they reach a critical stage. Early identification of at-risk individuals based on lifestyle patterns allows for timely intervention — reducing long-term healthcare costs and improving outcomes.

## Dataset

- Source: Mental Health and Lifestyle Habits Dataset (2019–2024), Kaggle
- 3,000 records across 12 features
- Features: age, gender, sleep hours, exercise level, diet type, work hours, screen time, social interaction score, happiness score
- Target: binary risk classification (High Risk / Low Risk)

## Model Performance

| Model | F1 Score | AUC |
|---|---|---|
| Logistic Regression | 0.707 | 0.817 |
| Random Forest | 0.740 | 0.807 |
| XGBoost | 0.714 | 0.792 |

Best model: Random Forest (F1: 0.740). Sleep Hours is the strongest predictor (importance: 0.477).
